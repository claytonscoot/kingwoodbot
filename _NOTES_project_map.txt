🧭 Astro Outdoor Designs – Fence Assistant
Folder: kingwoodbot/

⚙️ PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project is a self‑contained fence quote chatbot and lead capture web app built with:

Frontend: HTML/CSS/JS (chat.html, admin.html)
Backend: FastAPI (main.py)
Data storage: CSV files for leads
Optional AI: Ollama local LLM (used for smart chat responses)
Local startup script: start.bat
Users can chat to describe their project, get a working estimate, and submit a quote request.
Submitted data is saved locally and viewable in the admin dashboard.

📂 FILE STRUCTURE & PURPOSE
File / Folder	Description
main.py	FastAPI backend server. Handles routes /, /chat, /lead, /admin, /admin/data, /live-quote, etc. Creates and updates leads.csv, manages sessions, and talks to Ollama if installed.
chat.html	Public chat interface. The customer uses this to describe their fencing project. It calls /chat for responses and /lead to request a quote.
admin.html	Internal dashboard. Displays stats and recent leads by calling GET /admin/data.
leads.csv	Local storage of submitted quote requests (appended by /lead). Each row: timestamp, IP, name, phone, email, address, contact method, project details, session ID, status.
start.bat	Windows batch file. Runs the FastAPI backend automatically (python main.py).
templates/	Currently unused directory. Reserved for Jinja2 templates later (if site expands).
pycache/	Auto-generated Python cache folder (can ignore).
